# Functional Requirements: CCTV Discovery Tool

## 1. Project Overview
- **Application Name**: CCTV Discovery
- **Platform**: Windows (x64)
- **Language**: Java 1.8
- **Build System**: Apache Maven 3.x
- **Key Dependencies**: JavaCV (FFmpeg), Apache POI (Excel), SLF4J, JUnit 5/Mockito.

## 2. Discovery & Detection Module
The application must discover IP cameras and NVR/DVR systems using three distinct methods:

### 2.1 ONVIF Discovery
- **Protocol**: WS-Discovery (UDP Multicast)
- **Address**: `239.255.255.250`
- **Port**: `3702`
- **Timeout**: `3000 ms`
- **Probe Payload**: Standard SOAP Probe for `dn:NetworkVideoTransmitter`.
- **Response Parsing**: Extracts XAddrs (Service URL) and IP address.
- **Priority**: Primary discovery method.

### 2.2 Port Scanning
- **Target**: Specific TCP ports frequently used by cameras and NVRs.
- **Ports Scanned**:
  - RTSP: `554`, `8554`
  - HTTP: `80`, `8080`, `8000`
  - HTTPS: `443`, `8443`
  - Vendor Specific: `5000`, `5001` (Synology), `37777`, `37778` (Dahua), `7447` (Reolink), `9000`, `9001`.
- **Concurrency**: Dynamic thread pool (size based on CPU cores, max 50 threads).
- **Socket Timeout**: `500 ms` per port connection.
- **Logic**: If port 80/8080 is found, constructs probable ONVIF URL (`/onvif/device_service`). If RTSP ports found, marks as candidate.

### 2.3 Manufacturer Detection
- **Detection Strategy (Priority Order)**:
  1.  **ONVIF Data**: Reads `Manufacturer` field from `GetDeviceInformation` response.
  2.  **MAC Address OUI**:
      -   Performs `arp -a [IP]` command execution to retrieve device MAC address.
      -   Matches first 3 octets (OUI) against internal database.
      -   **Database**: Hikvision, Dahua (and sub-brands), Axis, TP-Link, Foscam, Reolink, Amcrest, Ubiquiti.
  3.  **HTTP Headers**:
      -   Sends `HEAD` request to HTTP ports (80, 8080, 443, 8000).
      -   Analyzes `Server` and `WWW-Authenticate` headers for keywords (e.g., "Hikvision", "Dahua", "CP Plus", "Axis").
- **Fallback**: Defaults to "Generic" if no match found.

## 3. Authentication Module
The application must attempt to authenticate with discovered devices to access streams and metadata.

### 3.1 Credential Management
- Supports list of credentials (Username/Password pairs).
- **Rotation Logic**: Tries each credential pair sequentially until success or exhaustion.
- **Validation**: Skips empty credentials.

### 3.2 Authentication Modes
- Supports and attempts three authentication types in order:
  1.  **Digest Authentication** (Standard ONVIF)
  2.  **Plain Text** (Weak/Legacy)
  3.  **None/Anonymous** (Public streams)
- **Error Handling**: Handles 401/403 errors by proceeding to next method/credential. 400 Bad Request triggers fallback.

### 3.3 Information Retrieval
- **ONVIF Services**:
  - `GetDeviceInformation`: Manufacturer, Model, Serial, Firmware.
  - `GetHostname` / `GetScopes`: Device Name.
  - `GetSystemDateAndTime`: Calculates time drift from local system time.

## 4. Stream Analysis & NVR Support
The application must identify and validate RTSP video streams.

### 4.1 NVR/DVR Channel Extraction
- **Method**: ONVIF `GetProfiles` via `Media Service`.
- **Logic**:
  - Detects multiple profiles (Main/Sub streams).
  - Extracts channel numbers from profile names (e.g., "Channel01", "Profile_1", "Ch-1").
  - **Expansion**: Explodes a single NVR IP into multiple "Camera" objects, one per channel.

### 4.2 Stream Discovery
- **Primary Method**: ONVIF `GetStreamUri` (RTSP, Unicast, TCP).
- **Secondary Method (Fallback)**: **RTSP URL Guessing**.
  - Triggered if ONVIF fails or returns no stream.
  - **Pattern Source**:
    1.  `rtsp-patterns.txt` (External configuration file).
    2.  Hardcoded Patterns (Internal Map based on Manufacturer).
    3.  Generic Fallback Patterns (`/live/main`, `/stream1`, etc.).
  - **Pattern Features**: Supports format strings for channel numbers (e.g., `/user/channel%d`).
  - **Execution**: Parallel execution (Thread pool) for fast guessing.
  - **Validation**: Attempts to connect to guessed URL using FFmpeg (2s timeout).

### 4.3 Stream Probing (Verification)
- **Tool**: JavaCV / FFmpeg (`FFmpegFrameGrabber`).
- **Transport**: TCP (`rtsp_transport=tcp`).
- **Timeout**: `10 seconds` (10,000 ms).
- **Metrics Collected**:
  - Video Codec (e.g., h264, hevc).
  - Resolution (Width x Height).
  - Bitrate (Calculated or reported).
  - Frame Rate (FPS).
- **Error Reporting**: Categorizes errors (Auth Failure, Connection Refused, Timeout, Not Found).

## 5. User Interface & Reporting
- **GUI**: Swing-based, Wizard style.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars for Discovery, Auth, and Probing phases.
- **Cancellation**: Support for stopping operations mid-process (Graceful shutdown).
- **Export**:
  - **Format**: valid `.xlsx` file.
  - **Library**: Apache POI.
  - **Columns**: IP, MAC, Manufacturer, Model, Name, Serial, Firmware, Time Diff, Credentials, Main RTSP (URL, Res, Codec, Bitrate, FPS), Sub RTSP (URL, Res, Codec, Bitrate, FPS), Error.
  - **Styling**: Bold headers, frozen top row, monospaced font for technical data.

## 6. Build & Deployment Requirements
- **JDK**: Java 8 compatible.
- **Packaging**:
  - `maven-assembly-plugin`: Creates fat JAR (`jar-with-dependencies`).
  - `launch4j-maven-plugin`: Wraps JAR into Windows EXE (`CctvDiscovery.exe`) with icon.
  - `maven-resources-plugin`: Bundles local JRE (`jre8` folder) for portability.
  - `maven-antrun-plugin`: Creates distribution ZIP containing EXE, JRE, and `rtsp-patterns.txt`.
- **Code Signing**:
  - Uses PowerShell to generate Self-Signed Certificate (`cert.pfx`).
  - Uses `signtool` to sign the executable (Timestamped).

## 7. Configuration Files
- **`rtsp-patterns.txt`**: Text file for custom RTSP URL patterns.
  - Format per line: `main_stream_path, sub_stream_path`
  - Comments supported with `#`.
  - Section headers supported (e.g. `# Hikvision`) to associate patterns with manufacturers.

## 8. User Experience & Non-Technical Overview
This section describes the application's behavior from a user's perspective, focusing on "what" it does rather than "how".

### 8.1 Core Purpose
The tool is designed to help technicians and security integrators quickly audit a network for CCTV cameras, identifying what devices are present, whether they are accessible, and if their video streams are configured correctly.

### 8.2 Operational Flow
1.  **Launch**: The user runs the application directly (portable) without needing to install specific drivers.
2.  **Scan**: The user starts a discovery process. The tool automatically searches the local network for devices.
3.  **Identify**: It identifies the brand and model of cameras (e.g., Hikvision, Dahua) and distinguishes between individual cameras and recording boxes (NVRs).
4.  **Access**: The user provides a list of common passwords. The tool automatically tries these passwords on every found camera to see which ones work.
5.  **Analyze**: For every accessible camera, the tool checks the video feed to report its clarity (resolution), format, and smoothness, verifying that the main high-quality stream and the lower-quality sub-stream are both working.
6.  **Report**: The final result is a professional Excel spreadsheet listing every device, its IP address, the password that worked, and the technical details of the video quality, ready for documentation or troubleshooting.

### 8.3 Key Usability Features
-   **No Setup Required**: Works out-of-the-box on Windows.
-   **Visual Feedback**: Shows a progress bar so the user knows the tool is working and hasn't frozen.
-   **Graceful Stop**: The user can cancel the scan at any time if it's taking too long.
-   **Intelligent NVR Handling**: If an NVR is found, the tool doesn't just list the NVR; it lists every single camera channel connected to it individually.
-   **Error Clarity**: If a camera fails to connect, the tool tells the user why (e.g., "Wrong Password" vs "Device Offline") in simple terms.
